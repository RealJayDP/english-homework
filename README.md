a React app for practicing English words with their Swedish translations, I'll set up a new React project and implement a simple interface where your daughter can practice. The app will:

Load a JSON file with English-Swedish word pairs.
Show an English word and let the user type the Swedish translation.
Check the answer and provide feedback.
Allow moving to the next word.
